# Blockchain_simulation
This project demonstrates a basic blockchain implementation using JavaScript. It simulates the core concepts of a blockchain, including blocks, hashing, and validation. Each block stores a set of data (such as transactions), a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block via its hash. The blockchain ensures data integrity by validating each blockâ€™s hash and its connection to the previous block.

Key features:

Block creation: Each block contains an index, timestamp, data, previous block hash, and its own hash.
Genesis block: The first block in the chain (with no predecessor).
Chain validation: Ensures the integrity of the blockchain by verifying hashes and preventing tampering.
Example use case: Simulates a series of transactions and checks the validity of the chain.
This simple implementation demonstrates how blockchain can be used to securely store data with a distributed ledger, emphasizing immutability and transparency.
